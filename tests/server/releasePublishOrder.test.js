 * A failed release used to leave Docker Hub ahead of a release that no longer

 * build-docker ran beside build-binaries rather than after it, and it published

 * then failed, cleanup-on-failure deleted the tag and the draft release - it has
 * no reach into a registry - so `:latest` was left pointing at a version with no
 * GitHub release behind it, and nothing anywhere said so.
 *
 * Not hypothetical: it happened three times on the night 1.3.3 was cut, once per
 * failed attempt, and `docker pull myspeed` resolved to an unreleased build for
 * about four hours.
 *
 * The split that fixes it falls along a line the pipeline already had. The
 * per-arch jobs push by digest, which publishes an untagged blob that nothing
 * resolves to and no one can pull by name; only the manifest merge creates a
 * tag. So the merge moved into publish-docker.yml, held behind the binaries,
 * while the builds - the slow half, and the half that proves the image runs on
 * both architectures - still run beside them.
 *
 * A digest push left behind by a failed release is the deliberate remainder:
 * unreferenced, invisible to `docker pull`, and collectable, which is a
 * different thing from a moved tag.
